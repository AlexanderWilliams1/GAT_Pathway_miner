# CNN Crypto Trader# GATv2-Based Gene Regulatory Network Link Prediction
Overview
This repository implements a Graph Attention Network (GATv2) for link prediction in biological networks, specifically designed for identifying novel gene regulatory interactions. The model combines prior knowledge from biological databases with gene expression data to predict previously uncharacterized regulatory relationships.


Key Features
Advanced GATv2 Architecture: Implements GATv2Conv with LayerNorm for improved attention mechanisms
Comprehensive Evaluation: Reports AUROC, AUPRC, and Precision@K metrics
Robust Validation: 5-fold cross-validation with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
Biological Network Specific: Designed for sparse, imbalanced biological networks
Data Leakage Prevention: Careful edge splitting strategy to avoid contamination


Model Architecture
Encoder: Two-layer GATv2 with multi-head attention and ELU activations
Decoder: Dot product decoder for edge prediction
Regularization: Layer normalization and dropout for improved generalization


Workflow
Data Preparation: Align gene expression data with prior network edges
Network Construction: Build graph from TF-target interactions
Edge Splitting: Split edges into training/validation/test sets
Hyperparameter Optimization: Bayesian optimization with Optuna
Cross-validation: 5-fold CV for robust performance assessment
Novel Edge Prediction: Predict top-scoring novel regulatory interactions
